# <b><font size=10> Wine Quality Classification </b></font>

<p> <font size=3> In the industry of wine production, assessing the quality of the product itself is very important. The consumers' safety and satisfaction must be assured especially by different wine industries and companies. If the product has bad qualities, it might pose different health risks and affect the safety of the consumers as well as lead to their dissatisfaction. 

In this work, I've built a classification model that will determie if a certain wine product will pass the quality test using Machine Learning. The quality or output variable (ranges from 0-10) of the wine product will be based on different sensory data provided inside the dataset. The dataset came from *[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)* which contains the physicochemical and sensory variables of different wine product examples. This is related to the red variants of the Portuguese "*Vinho Verde*" wine. The dataset is in Comma-Separated Values (csv) format and has a total of 12 columns and 1600 rows. 

The columns are: 
1. fixed acidity
2. volatile acidity
3. citric acid
4. residual sugar
5. chlorides
6. free sulfur dioxide
7. total sulfur dioxide
8. density
9. pH
10. sulphates
11. alcohol; and 
12. quality (target column) </p>
